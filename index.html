					<h2>Philadelphia Movers</h2>

					<p>I'm Ben the Mover Guy. I run a fully licensed and insured moving crew, based out of West Philly. Our service is ideal for:</p>

					<div class = "thumbnail-box">

						<ul class= "about-dot-list">

							<li>Residential moves</li>

							<li> Office moves</li>

							<li> Loading/unloading storage units/pods</li>

							<li> Furniture pickup/delivery</li>

							<li> Dump runs/Goodwill runs</li>

							<li> Packing/unpacking services</li>

						</ul>

						</a>

​

					</div>	

					<p style = "clear:both">Our mission is to provide our clients with a service that is not only honest and affordable, but a service that you can trust to get the job done with the highest quality of care!</p>

					<p>This is a VERY SMALL operation! I book all my own clients, handle all of my logistics, and I am in the field everyday personally taking care of every job, with my crew.</p>

					<p>I started Ben the Mover Guy in Seattle, Washington in 2015, and established the operation in Philadelphia as an LLC in April of 2017. Before starting BTMG, I have paid dues working for numerous “white glove” delivery/courier services, as well as large-scale household moving services. </p>

					<p>My crew is a carefully selected team of moving experts who share my love for moving homes, and building a business that the community can appreciate and benefit from!

						I am passionate about moving! It is a line of work that I enjoy taking my time to perfect and master; my goal is to build long-term client relationships so we can keep the good times rolling!</p>

					<p>We work with a 15ft box truck for most jobs, but we also offer a sprinter van for small-scale moves and small deliveries. The van can fit more than you probably think! It has been extensively modified to maximize its cargo space, and it comes in handy for navigating the narrower streets in South and North Philly.</p>

					<p>The vehicle is included in the hourly rates, as is our equipment, and there are no mileage or commute fees for any work within the city of Philly. This is an honest, no-frills operation, and we want you to save money on your move!</p>

					<p>We also offer "LABOR-ONLY" rates, if our truck does not suit your needs. A bigger truck rental can always be arranged for an additional fee.

						No job is too big or small!</p>

						<ul class = "thumbnail-text about-dot-list">

							<li><span>We show up to every job with dollies, a hand truck, tie-downs, moving pads, tools and tape. Additional materials such as floor protector mats, shrink wrap, mattress pads, boxes and miscellaneous packing materials can be provided for an additional fee.</span></li>

							<li><span>I take pride in my work. Your satisfaction is my priority.</span></li>

							<li><span>Proof of insurance is available upon request.</span></li>
