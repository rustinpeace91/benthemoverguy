					<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
					<p>YOUR SIMPLEST, MOST AFFORDABLE INNER-CITY MOVING OPTION.</p>
					<p>I'm Ben the Mover Guy. I'm a licensed, insured, and experienced mover with a crew and an upgraded Ford E350 Cargo Van. I'm based out of West Philadelphia and I offer the CHEAPEST MOVING SERVICE IN TOWN, GUARANTEED. With a primary focus on small residences and office spaces, my service is ideal for:</p>
					<ul class = "asterisk-list">
						<li> Small-scale residential moves</li>
						<li> Office moves</li>
						<li> Loading/unloading storage units/pods</li>
						<li> Furniture pickup/delivery</li>
						<li> Dump runs/Goodwill runs</li>
						<li> Packing/unpacking services</li>
					</ul>
					<p>I am passionate about moving! It is a line of work that I find fulfilling, and that I enjoy perfecting and mastering. I have over 5+ years industry experience and I like to think I'm exceptionally good at what I do. My goal is build long-term client relationships so we can keep the good times rolling!</p>
					<p>My van's name is Xena. It can haul more than you probably think and we have triumphed hundreds of jobs together. Its cargo space measures roughly 6 x 5 x 11 ft. I have modified it extensively to maximize its cargo capacity - including a 2-foot raised roof, shelving and tie-down panels. It may not be the biggest vehicle, but it can maneuver around Philly's most congested areas with much more ease than a box truck.</p>
					<p>I also offer "LABOR-ONLY" rates, if Xena doesn't suit your needs. A truck rental can always be arranged for an additional fee.
